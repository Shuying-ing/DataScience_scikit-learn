- outlier detection: detect the deviant observations in the training data
    1. Fitting an elliptic envelope: Assume that the regular data come from a known distribution, fit an ellipse to the central data points, based on MCD Mahalanobis distances
    2. Isolation Forest: In high-dimensional datasets

- novelty detection: detecting whether a new observation is an outlier
    - One-class SVM algorithm
